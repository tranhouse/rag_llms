Implications and applications are discussed. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\nWhen it comes to writing, most experts agree that clarity, simplicity and parsimony are\\nideals that authors should strive for. In their classic manual of style, Strunk and White\\n(1979) encourage authors to ‘omit needless words.’ Daryl Bem’s (1995) guidelines for\\nsubmission to Psychological Bulletin advise, ‘the ﬁrst step towards clarity is writing\\nsimply.’ Even the APA publication manual (1996) recommends, ‘direct, declarative\\nsentences with simple common words are usually best.’\\nHowever, most of us can likely recall having read papers, either by colleagues or\\nstudents, in which the author appears to be deliberately using overly complex words.\\nExperience suggests that the experts’ advice contrasts with prevailing wisdom on how to\\nsound more intelligent as a writer. In fact, when 110 Stanford undergraduates were polled\\nabout their writing habits, most of them admitted that they had made their writing more\\ncomplex in order to appear smarter. For example, when asked, ‘Have you ever changed the\\nwords in an academic essay to make the essay sound more valid or intelligent by using\\ncomplicated language?’ 86.4% of the sample admitted to having done so. Nearly two-\\nthirds answered yes to the question, ‘When you write an essay, do you turn to the thesaurus\\nto choose words that are more complex to give the impression that the content is more\\nvalid or intelligent?’\\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\n*Correspondence to: D.

Intelligence and large vocabularies are positively\\ncorrelated (Spearman, 1904). Therefore, by displaying a large vocabulary, one may be\\nproviding cues that he or she is intelligent as well. Secondly, writers are assumed to be\\nconforming to the Gricean maxim of manner, ‘avoid obscurity of expression’ (Grice,\\n1975). If authors are believed to be writing as simply as possible, but a text is nonetheless\\ncomplex, a reader might believe that the ideas expressed in that text are also complex,\\ndefying all attempts to simplify the language. Further, individuals forced to struggle\\nthrough a complex text might experience dissonance if they believe that the ideas being\\nconveyed are simple (Festinger, 1957). Thus, individuals might be motivated to perceive a\\ndifﬁcult text as being more worthwhile, thereby justifying the effort of processing.\\nIndeed, there is some evidence that complex vocabulary can be indicative of a more\\nintelligent author. For example, Penneba ker and King (1999) have shown that the\\npercentage of long words used in class as signments positively correlates with SAT\\nscores and exam grades on both multiple cho ice and essay tests. However it is difﬁcult\\nto draw conclusions about the effectiveness of a strategy of complexity from this data.\\nThe study did not look at how readers of the texts containing the long words perceived\\nthe authors’ intelligence. Thus, it is possi ble that although students using complex\\nvocabularies are objectively very knowledgeable, they might nonetheless be perceived\\nas being less so.\\nWhy might we believe that the experts might be correct in recommending simplicity in\\nwriting? One theory that predicts the effectiveness of straightforward writing is that of\\nprocessing ﬂuency. Simpler writing is easier to process, and studies have demonstrated\\nthat processing ﬂuency is associated with a variety of positive dimensions. Fluency leads\\nto higher judgements of truth (Reber & Schwarz, 1999), conﬁdence (Norwick & Epley,\\n2002), frequency (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), fame (Jacoby, Kelley, Brown, &\\nJasechko, 1989), and even liking (Reber, Winkielman, & Schwarz, 1998). Furthermore,\\nthe effects of ﬂuency are strongest when the ﬂuency is discrepant—when the amount of\\nexperienced ﬂuency is surprising (Whittlesea & Williams, 2001a, 2001b). As such, it\\nwould not be surprising if the lower ﬂuency of overly complex texts caused readers to have\\nnegative evaluations of those texts and the associated authors, especially if the complexity\\nwas unnecessary and thus surprising readers with the relative disﬂuency of the text.\\nBoth the experts and prevailing wisdom present plausible views, but which (if either) is\\ncorrect? The present paper provides an empirical investigation of the strategy of complex-\\nity, and ﬁnds such a strategy to be unsuccessful. Five studies demonstrate that the loss of\\nﬂuency due to needless complexity in a text negatively impacts raters’ assessments of the\\ntext’s authors.\\nEXPERIMENT 1\\nExperiment 1 aimed to answer several simple questions. First, does increasing the\\ncomplexity of text succeed in making the author appear more intelligent? Second, to\\nwhat extent does the success of this strategy depend on the quality of the original, simpler\\nwriting? Finally, if the strategy is unsuccessful, is the failure of the strategy due to loss of\\nﬂuency? To answer these questions, graduate school admission essays were made more\\ncomplex by substituting some of the original words with their longest applicable thesaurus\\nentries.\\n140 D. M.

Using length as a manipulation of complexity allows for a\\nsimple, easily replicable word replacement algorithm. By keeping content constant and\\nvarying the complexity of vocabulary, it was possible to investigate the effectiveness of\\ncomplexity.\\nParticipants and procedure\\nSeventy-one Stanford University undergraduates participated to fulﬁl part of a course\\nrequirement. The survey was included in a packet of unrelated one-page questionnaires.\\nPackets were distributed in class, and participants were given a week to complete the entire\\npacket.\\nStimuli and design\\nSix personal statements for admissions to graduate studies in English Literature were\\ndownloaded from writing improvement websites. The essays varied greatly both in content\\nand quality of writing. Logical excerpts ranging from 138 to 253 words in length were then\\ntaken from each essay. A ‘highly complex’ version of each excerpt was prepared by\\nreplacing every noun, verb and adjective with its longest entry in the Microsoft Word 2000\\nthesaurus. Words that were longer than any thesaurus entry, were not listed in the\\nthesaurus, or for which there was no entry with the same linguistic sense were not\\nreplaced. If two entries were of the same length, the replacement was chosen alphabe-\\ntically. When necessary, minor modiﬁcations were made to the essay to maintain the\\ngrammatical structure of a sentence (e.g. replacing ‘an’ with ‘a’ for replacement words\\nbeginning with consonants). A ‘moderately complex’ version of each excerpt was created\\nusing the same algorithm as above, except replacing only every third applicable word.\\nExamples of the stimuli can be found in the appendix.\\nEach participant received only one excerpt. Participants were informed that the excerpt\\ncame from a personal statement for graduate study in the Stanford English department.\\nThey were instructed to read the passage, decide whether or not to accept the applicant,\\nand rate their conﬁdence in their decision on a 7-point scale. 1 They were then asked how\\ndifﬁcult the passage was to understand, also on a seven-point scale.\\nResults\\nThe data of one participant was discarded due to an illegible answer. Analysis of the\\nmanipulation check showed that more complex texts were more difﬁcult to read. ( x ¼ 2.9,\\n4.0 and 4.3 for simple, moderately complex and highly complex, respectively). These\\ndifferences were reliable, F(2, 68) ¼ 4.46, p < 0.05, Cohen’s f ¼ 0.18. For other analyses,\\nacceptance ratings ( þ1 for accept, /C01 for reject) were multiplied by conﬁdence ratings to\\ncreate a /C07 to 7 scale of admission conﬁdence. Level of complexity had a reliable\\ninﬂuence on admission conﬁdence ratings, F(2, 70) ¼ 2.46, p < 0.05, Cohen’s f ¼ 0.12.\\n1With the exception of the dichotomous admissions decision, all dependent measures reported in this paper are\\nseven point scales ranging from 1 ¼ ‘not at all’ to 7¼ ‘very’.\\nProblems with long words 141\\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
